The file contains code for our project for the course of "Object Oriented Programming" where we created a block stacking game from stack. We created this project using C++ and the sfml library which helped us with the graphics of the game. The .h files are the header files while the .cpp files contain the code and the rest of the files are from the SFML library to generate graphics.
